# Windows Log Monitoring with Splunk Cloud

This is a real-world cybersecurity and DevOps project that uses the **Splunk Universal Forwarder** to collect logs from a local **Windows 10/11** system and forward them to **Splunk Cloud** for centralized log analysis and monitoring.

---

## üéØ Project Objective

To demonstrate how logs can be forwarded from a local Windows endpoint to a cloud-based SIEM (Splunk Cloud) for:

- Centralized log management  
- Security event detection  
- Dashboard creation and alerting  
- Hands-on experience with Splunk Search Processing Language (SPL)

---

## üì¶ Use Case

- Forward Windows Event Logs to Splunk Cloud:
  - Security
  - System
  - Application
  - PowerShell
  - Sysmon (via Sysmon config)
- Monitor endpoint behavior:
  - User logins (successful and failed)
  - Privilege escalation attempts
  - Script and PowerShell execution
- Visualize data using dashboards and panels
- Enable real-time threat detection and incident investigation

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies

- Windows 10/11
- Splunk Universal Forwarder
- Splunk Cloud Trial
- Sysmon (for enhanced logging)
- Search Processing Language (SPL)
- Event Viewer & PowerShell

## üìä Sample Dashboards & Visualizations

Here are some example panels included in the Splunk dashboard:

### üîê Login Activity Panel

- **Failed Logins per User**
  - Helps detect brute-force login attempts.

- **Successful Logins per User**
  - Tracks legitimate user access patterns.

### üö® Privilege Escalation Events

- Identifies users who triggered Event ID 4672 (Special Privileges Assigned).
- Useful for detecting unauthorized administrative access attempts.

### üî¢ Top Event Codes

- Displays the most frequent event codes logged.
- Can be used to monitor:
  - Repeated login failures (4625)
  - Service installations
  - Security policy changes

### üß† Script Execution Tracking

- Uses Event ID 4104 (PowerShell logs) and Sysmon logs.
- Flags suspicious command-line or script activity.

### üîç Log Search

- Uses the Splunk Search & Reporting App.
- Enables ad-hoc querying using SPL to filter and investigate raw log events.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Install the [Splunk Universal Forwarder](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/download/universal-forwarder.html) on your Windows system.
2. Enable the required Windows Event Log channels.
3. Set up forwarder credentials using your Splunk Cloud deployment.
4. Configure inputs.conf to monitor event logs.
5. Verify connectivity on port 9997.
6. Visualize the logs in Splunk Cloud using dashboards or SPL queries.

## ‚úÖ Sample SPL Queries

```spl
index=main sourcetype="WinEventLog:Security" EventCode=4625
| stats count by user, host
| sort -count

index=main sourcetype="WinEventLog:Security" EventCode=4672
| table _time, user, host

index=main sourcetype="XmlWinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell/Operational" EventCode=4104
| table _time, user, Message

```
